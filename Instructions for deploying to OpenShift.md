# OpenEMR-Kube

# The purpose of this project is to make it possible to quickly deploy a fully functional, ONC certified electronic health records system (EHR) as a Kubernetes resource. While these instructions should work in any current Kubernetes environment, the target Kubernetes platform for these instructions is [OpenShift.com](https://openshift.com)

### Perequisites
You must have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. Please sign up a free OpenShfit account at [manage.openshift.com](https://manage.openshift.com). You are also encouraged to fork this project on Github so that you may make custom edits.

### Steps
1. From the OpenShift portal, download the Command Line Tools from the Help (? button) menu. Download the ``oc`` command line client for your platform. e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows. The ``oc`` tool is available through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as well: ``brew install openshift-cli``

2. In the OpenShift portal click your name, then click "Copy the Login Command", then paste that command into your command line. e.g., ``` oc login --token=VAw1hSirRaUmLKuGgGsZe0_mbKEtGdia5NXokYfTxc4 --server=https://api.us-east-1.starter.openshift-online.com:6443 ```

3. From the command line, type in a new for your project. ``` oc new-project openemr ```

4. Clone this repository to your local system. e.g., ``` git clone https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/openemr-kube.git ```, then cd into the directory.

5. Run: ``` oc apply -f artifacts/mysql/ ```

6. Then run ``` oc apply -f artifacts/phpmyadmin/ ```

7. Deploy OpenEMR by running: ``` oc apply -f artifacts/openemr/ ```

8. Finally, run: ``` oc apply -f artifacts/openemr-firstboot ```

9. List names of services. ``` oc get svc ```

10. Create a route. e.g., ``` oc expose svc/openemr --hostname=emr.youdomain.com ```

11. Set cookie:  ``` oc get routes ``` then set the cookie e.g., ``` oc annotate route openemr router.openshift.io/cookie_name=my_cookie ``` Setting a the cookie is important if you have multipule instances of OpenEMR containers running https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/routes.html

## Other tips and recommendations

### Secure your OpenEMR instance with SSL support through Let's Encrypt

[https://github.com/tnozicka/openshift-acme](https://github.com/tnozicka/openshift-acme)

``oc apply -fhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnozicka/openshift-acme/master/deploy/single-namespace/{role,serviceaccount,issuer-letsencrypt-live,deployment}.yaml``

``oc create rolebinding openshift-acme --role=openshift-acme --serviceaccount="$( oc project -q ):openshift-acme" --dry-run -o yaml | oc apply -f -``

``oc annotate route openemr kubernetes.io/tls-acme=true``

### You must also add the Let's Encrypt/OpenShift-Acme secret to your OpenEMR container

``oc annotate route openemr acme.openshift.io/secret-name=letsencrypt-live``

### Consider setting up autoscaling, which is one of the great benefits of deploying to OpenShift

``oc autoscale deploy openemr --min=2 --max=10``

``oc autoscale deployment.apps/openemr --max=5 --cpu-percent=80``
