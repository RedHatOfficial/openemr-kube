# Openemr-kube
# The purpose of this project is to make it possible to quickly deploy a fully functional electronic health records system (EHR) 
# as a Kubernetes resource. While these instructions should work in any current Kubernetes environment. The target Kubernetes platform for these is OpenShift.com

2. In the OpenShift portal click your name, then click "Copy the Login Command", then paste that command into your command line. e.g., ``` oc login --token=VAw1hSirRaUmLKuGgGsZe0_mbKEtGdia5NXokYfTxc4 --server=https://api.us-east-1.starter.openshift-online.com:6443 ```

3. From the command line, type in a new for your project. ``` oc new-project openemr ```

4. Clone this repository to your local system. e.g., ``` git clone https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/openemr-kube.git ```, then cd into the directory.

5. Run: ``` oc apply -f artifacts/mysql/ ```

6. Then run ``` oc apply -f artifacts/phpmyadmin/ ```

7. Deploy OpenEMR by running: ``` oc apply -f artifacts/openemr/ ```

8. Finally, run: ``` oc apply -f artifacts/openemr-firstboot ```

9. List names of services. ``` oc get svc ```

10. Create a route. ``` oc expose svc/openemr --hostname=emr2.apps.cloudapps.northwestern.edu ```

11. Set cookie:  ``` oc get routes ```  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/routes.html then set the cookie e.g., ``` oc annotate route openemr router.openshift.io/cookie_name=my_cookie ```
